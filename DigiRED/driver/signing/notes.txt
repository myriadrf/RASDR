= Signing =

From reading [1], I have boiled down the information to that which is minimially relevant.

== Background ==

* There are at least five ways to install a driver package. First, the user can right-click on the INF file and select "Install" if the INF file has a DefaultInstall [2] section.
* Second, a program can call the SetupCopyOEMInf function.
* Third, a program or user can run PnPUtil [3].
* Fourth, a user can right-click on a matching device in the Device Manager, select "Update driver software...", and then tell Windows the directory where the driver package is stored. 
*  Fifth, the driver package can be shipped with DPInst [4] executables that install it. 

"To get a friendly message when the driver install is attempted, you will need [1]: The name in the prompt comes from from the INF file's DriverPackageDisplayName directive and the publisher comes from the verified signature on the CAT file. 

Windows 10 kernel modules must be signed by the portal

Microsoft announced that all new Windows 10 kernel mode drivers must be submitted to and digitally signed by the Windows Hardware Developer Center Dashboard Portal, which is a web service provided by Microsoft. Also, 90 days after the release of Windows 10, the portal will only accept driver submissions from you if you sign them with an Extended Validation (EV) certificate, which is typically more expensive than a normal certificate.

My recommendation would be to get your drivers signed and working on Windows 10 as soon as possible. Any signature that works on Windows 10 and has a timestamp will probably continue working for a long time, so you might not need to invest in an EV certificate." [David E. Grayson]

== Get software ==

Go to [5].  But if you do, you will most likely start installing 10GB worth of microsoft development tools.   So instead, just download these two files:
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=536682 (sdksetup.exe) - install first (2.4GB)
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526733 (wdksetup.exe) - install second (2.2GB)

install to 'C:\Program Files\Windows Kits\10\'

I ended up choosing everyting.  the WDK gave a warning about not having a compiler, etc.  Its ok, we're just doing this for the certification tools for now.

== Create a Test Signing Certificate, and install it on the local system ==

http://www.digitallycreated.net/Blog/38/using-makecert-to-create-certificates-for-development

== Create the signed packages ==

From [1, Signtool and inf2cat],  This is an example batch (.bat) script. You can simply drag an executable or MSI file onto it, and it will sign the file for you:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x86\signtool" sign /v /ac "your-cross-cert.crt" /n "Your company name" /fd sha1 /t http://timestamp.globalsign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll %1
pause

This is another example batch script. You can put it in the same directory as your driver package and then double-click on it to create the security catalog and sign it.

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x86\inf2cat" /v /driver:%~dp0 /os:XP_X86,Vista_X86,Vista_X64,7_X86,7_X64,8_X86,8_X64,6_3_X86,6_3_X64,10_X86,10_X64
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x86\signtool" sign /v /ac "your-cross-cert.crt" /n "Your company name" /tr http://timestamp.globalsign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll *.cat
pause

For both of these batch files, if you are using a cross-certificate, I recommend just putting the cross-certificate in the same directory as the batch file to make the /ac parameter simpler.

== Installation ==

Plan to make a batch script that will call the two functions below prior to loading the device driver for RASDR from the CD/USB stick.

From [6, pg 9-10], Before you can install your driver package, you must add your test certificates into the certificate store on the target test machine. The following example shows how to add the test certificates to the Trusted Root certificate store and the Trusted Publishers certificate store on the target test machine.
certmgr.exe -add OutputFile.cer -s -r localMachine root
certmgr.exe -add OutputFile.cer -s -r localMachine trustedpublisher


= Appendix =

Some places suggest turning test signing on for kernel mode signatures.  This is only needed if you are trying to use a kernel driver that is not signed with certificates that chain up to the root-of-trust that is pre-installed/updated in windows the registry.  For the purpose of RASDR, we are now using WHQL/signed drivers from Cypress, so we do not need this.

From [6, pg 16], The following shows an example of running BDCEdit at the command prompt:
// Accept test signed kernel mode signatures
Bcdedit.exe /set TESTSIGNING ON

// Do not accept test signed kernel mode signatures
Bcdedit.exe /set TESTSIGNING OFF
