Blink Error Codes for 'usb_rx.img' Sep 26, 2015

Upon an error condition, the firmware will emit an error code sequence on LED D6 of the digiRED board.  The code describes a two-digit code by blinking the most-significant, pause, then the least significant digit.  This is followed by a long pause and the code repeats.  The codes are defined as follows:

01	Invalid USB Speed
02	Producer EP configuration failed at INITIALIZATION
03	Consumer EP configuration failed at INITIALIZATION
04	DMA channel creation failed
05	Producer EP configuration failed at RESET/DISCONNECT
06	Consumer EP configuration failed at RESET/DISCONNECT
07	P-PORT initialization failed
08	GPIF load failed
09	GPIF state machine start failed
10	USB Set Descriptor failure (SS)
11	USB Set Descriptor failure (HS)
12	USB Set Descriptor failure (SS BOS)
13	USB Set Descriptor failure (DEV Qualifier)
14	USB Set Descriptor failure (SS CONFIG)
15	USB Set Descriptor failure (HS CONFIG)
16	USB Set Descriptor failure (FS CONFIG)
17	USB String Descriptor failure (0)
18	USB String Descriptor failure (1)
19	USB String Descriptor failure (2)
20	USB Start Failure
21	USB SS Start Failure
30	DMA channel commit buffer failure (UtoP)
31	DMA channel commit buffer failure (PtoU)
